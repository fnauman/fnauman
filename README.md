I am a AI & Machine Learning consultant based in Link√∂ping. I specialize in Time Series, Computer Vision and LLMs. I have 6+ years of experience in the AI and data science domain. 

My side projects are often related to computational fluid dynamics (PhD) and machine learning. I am fond of time series forecasting, which is what originally attracted me to machine learning. 

As of fall 2025, I am most excited to learn about Reinforcement Learning and how its sample efficiency can be leveraged in domains other than language like time series. If you'd like to collaborate, feel free to get in touch.
